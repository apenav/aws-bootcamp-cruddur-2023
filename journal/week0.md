### Create an Admin User
Followed a tutorial to create an OU and hierarchy of accounts, IAM, ... then used the simpler approach of adding user+group+permissions.
All of them with MFA.

AWS organizational units (OUs)
- projects
  - account IDs

IAM Identity providers AWS SSO (one of them Federated)

### Use CloudShell, Generate AWS Credentials, Installed AWS CLI
Just to test eveything was OK.
Scoop tool use to intall aws-cli on windows environment.

### Create a Billing Alarm
With command ``` aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/json/alarm_config.json --region us-east-1``` 
+ alarm_config.json:
```
{
  "AlarmName": "DailyEstimatedCharges",
  "AlarmDescription": "This alarm would be triggered if the daily estimated charges exceeds 1$",
  "ActionsEnabled": true,
  "AlarmActions": [
      "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN:billing-alarm"
  ],
  "EvaluationPeriods": 1,
  "DatapointsToAlarm": 1,
  "Threshold": 1,
  "ComparisonOperator": "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold",
  "TreatMissingData": "breaching",
  "Metrics": [{
      "Id": "m1",
      "MetricStat": {
          "Metric": {
              "Namespace": "AWS/Billing",
              "MetricName": "EstimatedCharges",
              "Dimensions": [{
                  "Name": "Currency",
                  "Value": "USD"
              }]
          },
          "Period": 86400,
          "Stat": "Maximum"
      },
      "ReturnData": false
  },
  {
      "Id": "e1",
      "Expression": "IF(RATE(m1)>0,RATE(m1)*86400,0)",
      "Label": "DailyEstimatedCharges",
      "ReturnData": true
  }]
}
```

#### When it was created a not needed Amazon EventBridge Rule

- Wrong decision to activate [AWS ControlTower](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/controltower/home/update) because [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/pricing/) USE 2-Configuration Items so they were Recorded :
  - 1 year log archive / $0.003 per Configuration Item recorded in US East 1 (N.Virginia) region 102.000 Configuration Item Recorded $0.31
  - 1 year security audit / $0.003 per Configuration Item recorded in US East 2 (Ohio) region 63.000 USE2-ConfigurationItemRecorded $0.19
similar to what happened to [AWS Config Charges](https://serebrov.github.io/html/2019-10-08-aws-config-charges.html)
```
Control tower - landing zone
- Your landing zone is being set up
- AWS Control Tower is setting up the following:

2 organizational units, one for your shared accounts and one for accounts that will be provisioned by your users.
3 shared accounts, which are the management account and isolated accounts for log archive and security audit.
A native cloud directory with preconfigured groups and single sign-on access.
20 preventive controls to enforce policies and 3 detective controls to detect configuration violations.
```
